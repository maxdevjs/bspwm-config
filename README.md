# bspwm-config
Configuration files for bspwm

Temporary repo for my bspwm config files.

Companion repo of this configuration is [maxdevjs/sxhkd-config](https://github.com/maxdevjs/sxhkd-config).
The idea is to manage all my dotfiles parts as submmodules, perhaps with [yadm](https://yadm.io/).

## Times of change

Overall, have been a few nice years with [i3](https://i3wm.org/) and [Solus](https://getsol.us/home/), nonetheless came the time to explore new horizons.

Alongside to Linux distros as [Void](https://voidlinux.org/) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/), I'm intrigued by a new, for me, `wm`: [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm).

I started to read [Prot's Dots For Debian](https://protesilaos.com/pdfd/), [Protesilaos Stavrou](https://protesilaos.com)'s guide. It is based on his Debian 10 'buster' dotfiles, but should not be a problem to adapt it to my [Void](https://voidlinux.org/) and [NixOS](https://nixos.org/) boxes.

Another interesting resource that I will explore later, is [Chrysostomus/bspwm-scripts](https://github.com/Chrysostomus/bspwm-scripts).
